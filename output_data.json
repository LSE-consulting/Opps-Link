Feedback is requested solely via the Microsoft Forms Questionnaire included in the \"DP2 Draft Requirements Supplier Questionnaire\" document attached to this notice - further information can be found in that attached document. \r\n\r\nAny responses received as part of this engagement will not be evaluated as part of a tender response and will not prejudice any involvement in a future procurement process.  \r\n\r\nThe Authority reserves the right:\r\n\u2022\tTo amend these requirements in advance of the formal ITT publication, which will be no earlier than May 2025;\r\n\u2022\tNot to proceed with the DP2 procurement.\r\n\r\nSuppliers are not entitled to claim from the Authority any costs or expenses that you may incur if you decide to start preparing your tender.\r\n\r\nDP2 Data Room Update  \r\nA Data Room for the potential DP2 procurement has been created within the Department's eSourcing portal, Jaggaer (accessible here: https://beisgroup.ukp.app.jaggaer.com/)\r\n\r\nAs previous communications and market engagement events have stated, the Fund Administration & Disbursement Services DPS (FAADS) RM6322 is DESNZ's indicative route to market. To access this Data Room, potential tenderers must register as a supplier on the FAADS DPS under Filter 5 - Full Programme Management; attached to this notice is a DP2 market engagement PowerPoint with instructions on how to sign up to the DPS.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Data Room is to share information from the Department and any incumbent suppliers with the market that is related to this requirement, prior to the release of a tender. Due to the confidential nature of some of this information, suppliers must sign and return a mandatory Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Once signed up to the FAADS DPS, please contact hthcommercial@energysecurity.gov.uk to receive the NDA and any further instructions.\r\n\r\nITT_2015 has been created for the purpose of sharing documents via a Data Room in Jaggaer before the ITT is released. The dates and times listed are solely for the purpose of creating the Data Room, and will be amended pending the outcome of internal governance and approvals processes. Should an ITT be published for this requirement, it will be done via this Jaggaer project (itt_2015).\r\n\r\nPlease note: There are currently no documents in the Data Room - this is a notice to inform you of its creation, location and our intent to publish information in there soon.\r\n\r\nPlease note: DESNZ reserves the right not to proceed with an ITT or procurement for DP2.",

                "description": "The UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero is procuring a supplier to manage a new facility - the Climate Innovation Pull Facility. Through pull finance, this facility will support innovation, scale up and market building for climate change mitigation solutions for developing country contexts, focusing on innovative clean energy technologies and business models in a small number of specific applications/sectors, where the evidence shows support is most needed.\r\n\r\nIn public innovation financing, &quot;pull mechanisms&quot; create incentives for innovators and other actors by creating viable market demand. They seek to reduce viability gaps and induce innovation by signalling demand for solutions to specific problems. Mechanisms often cited include Advanced Market Commitments, Results or Outcomes Based Financing, Prizes/Challenges, innovation bulk procurements, Contracts for Difference, among others. By contrast, much innovation support has to date utilised &quot;push mechanisms&quot; directly subsidising up-front R&amp;D costs.\r\n\r\nIn terms of climate mitigation solutions, the CIPF will support the development of innovation projects aligned to Ayrton Fund themes: industrial decarbonisation, sustainable cooling, smart energy systems and storage and clean transport Further details of Ayrton Fund thematic challenges are set out on gov.uk.\r\n\r\nThe procurement of this requirement will be in two parts:\r\n(i) A contract for a Facility Manager to manage the programme and identify, incubate, commission and oversee 6-10 climate pull projects of &#xA3;10m - &#xA3;50m each. This contract will also cover programme monitoring and learning.\r\n\r\nii) A separate contract for an Independent Evaluator of the programme, who will conduct a mid-term and end-of-term evaluation of the programme&amp;apos;s achievement of its development objectives, theory of change and value for money. This procurement is subject to a separate procurement procedure.\r\n\r\nThe procurement for the Facility Manager is the focus of this notice and will be run as a competitive procedure with negotiation. The initial contract value is &#xA3;183m over 5.5 years with options to extend by up to &#xA3;317m and up to 3 additional years. Of the &#xA3;183m initial contract value, at least &#xA3;150m of this will be allocated for climate pull projects, the majority of which will be grant funding.",

                "description": "Please note that this PIN is issued to inform the market of an upcoming market engagement event and is not a formal PIN marking the start of a procurement procedure.\r\n\r\nThe UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero is planning to procure an independent Evaluation Partner for the Climate Innovation Pull Facility (CIPF).  \r\n\r\nIn public innovation financing, &quot;pull mechanisms&quot; create incentives for innovators and other actors by creating viable market demand. They seek to reduce viability gaps and induce innovation by signalling demand for solutions to specific problems. Mechanisms often cited include Advanced Market Commitments, Results or Outcomes Based Financing, Prizes/Challenges, innovation bulk procurements, Contracts for Difference, among others. By contrast, much innovation support has to date utilised &quot;push mechanisms&quot; directly subsidising up-front R&amp;D costs. \r\n\r\nThe CIPF will support the development of 6-10 innovation projects, each worth between &#xA3;10m and &#xA3;50m, aligned to Ayrton Fund themes: industrial decarbonisation, sustainable cooling, smart energy systems and storage and clean transport. Further details of Ayrton Fund thematic challenges are set out on https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ayrton-fund \r\n\r\nThis procurement focuses on the Independent Evaluator. The Evaluator will conduct baseline, process, interim, and end-of-term evaluation of the programme&#039;s achievement of its intended impact, as defined by the Theory of Change and corresponding Logframe. At the project level, we anticipate a small number of deep-dive impact evaluations into a selection or combination of projects. The Evaluator will also assess programme preparedness for monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) at a programme and project level, by evaluating and providing feedback on the MEL products and processes the Facility Manager has developed.  The latter may form part of a broader process evaluation conducted to address questions the Authority or Facility Manager may have, e.g., relating to governance, impact, or project selection.  \r\n \r\nThe procurement will be run as an open competitive procedure and will be governed by the Procurement Act 2023. \r\n\r\nThe Department will be hosting a Market Engagement Event on 15 January 2025 at 11:00 GMT lasting 1-hour, to share early thinking on the evaluator deliverables and procurement procedure, with opportunity for feedback on the planned scope and approach. This is separate to the final market engagement event for the Facility Manager, also in January 2025. Please register to attend the EME here: https://forms.office.com/e/wPEGYAS4kC  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Initial contract value of &#xA3;2m for 5.5 years with options to extend an additional &#xA3;2m and up to an additional 3 year.\r\n \r\n\r\nA draft Specification will be uploaded by the Authority to the Jaggaer Opportunity Listing page by 06 January 2025.

Since 2023, the Government of Mauritius and the UK, as anchor donor of the trial, work in partnership to mobilise finance, strengthen climate policy, drive capacity building and manage inclusive platforms to coordinate climate finance activities. \r\n\r\nFollowing a period of consultation, the Taskforce has now finalised a Climate Finance Strategy and Roadmap with up to &#xA3;12 million (~MUR 736m) allocated to the Taskforce in Mauritius. The Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office is exploring options on how to deliver and manage Taskforce deliverables and is seeking input from the market. Deliverables may include technical assistance, management of a Climate Finance Stakeholders Platform and the design and operationalisation of a Climate Finance Unit. The Delivery Partner will work closely with the team which comprises a Senior Technical Cooperation Adviser and Programme Implementation Lead (FCDO), a Strategic Adviser (consultant) and teams across Government, private sector, civil society and academia.\r\n\r\nAn engagement event will take place on Wednesday 4 December at 10am (UK time).\r\n\r\nThis notice is for engagement purposes only and not a call for competition at this time.\r\n\r\nPlease follow the link to register for the event: https://forms.office.com/e/LHuTZ1EUm0",

If you are interested in applying to join the SEDPS or would like further information, please contact the National Highways Procurement Team at socialenterprisedps@nationalhighways.co.uk or visit our webpage below.\r\nhttps://nationalhighways.co.uk/suppliers/becoming-a-supplier/social-enterprises/ \r\n\r\nThe SEDPS is open for use by all Government Agency and Public Bodies for the full duration of the SEDPS that are identified in the following link: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations, Local Authorities in England and Wales who are identified in following link: https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/guidance-and-resources/communications-support/digital-councils/social-media/go-further/a-z-councils-online, Local Authorities in Scotland who are identified in the following link: https://www.mygov.scot/organisations, and Universities and educational providers who are identified in the following link: https://www.ucas.com/explore/search/providers?query=. \r\n\r\nThe SEDPS is also open for use by any organisations that directly (i.e. any organisation who has a live contract directly with National Highways) and indirectly (i.e. any organisations who has a live contract with a direct supplier of National Highways) provides works and/or goods and/or services to National Highways. If you are interested in using the SEDPS or would like further information, please contact the National Highways Procurement Team at socialenterprisedps@nationalhighways.co.uk.\r\n\r\nThe use of the SEDPS is to further National Highways&amp;apos; commitment to social value, in support of National Highways Social Value Plan.
